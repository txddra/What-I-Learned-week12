we went back to our *html/CSS* roots...

#### things i thought to be particularly interesting:
- event handlers
- event listeners

  ## Event Handlers

- Event handlers execute JavaScript code to respond to events whenever they occur
- Event Handlers can be divided into two parts:
  -  interactive Event Handlers
     -   An interactive Event Handler is the one that depends on the user interactivity with the form or the document. 
     -   
  -  non-interactive Event Handlers
     -   non-interactive Event Handler would be onload, because this Event Handler would automatically execute JavaScript code without the users interactivity. 

## Event Listeners

- The `addEventListener()` is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for, and a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets fired.

- Any number of event handlers can be added to a single element without overwriting existing event handlers.
